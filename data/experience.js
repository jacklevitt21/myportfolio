   PROJECT DATA
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Projects page (index.html) is split into two sections, controlled
   by each item's "section" field:
     - 'rocketry'  → shown under "Rocketry"
     - 'personal'  → shown under "Personal Projects"

   Each project also gets its own detail page in projects/<id>.html with
   a photo/design-file gallery.

   HOW TO ADD A NEW PROJECT
   1. Copy one of the objects below.
   2. Give it a unique "id" (no spaces) — this must match a file you
      create at projects/<id>.html (copy projects/_template.html).
   3. Set "section" to 'rocketry' or 'personal'.
   4. Fill in the fields, save, refresh.

   HOW TO ADD PHOTOS / DESIGN FILES TO A PROJECT
   Put image files in assets/images/<id>/ and list them in that
   project's "gallery" array, e.g.:
     gallery: [
       { src: 'assets/images/recovery-systems-lead/bulkhead.png', caption: 'Optimized bulkhead design' }
     ]
   Leave it as [] and the detail page will just show empty placeholder
   tiles reminding you to add images.

   FIELD GUIDE
   - oneLiner: short caption shown on the grid card (not the full bullets).
   - summary: shown at the top of the detail page — write this as context/
     why-it-matters framing, not a repeat of the bullets below it.
   - image: main thumbnail, shown on the card and at the top of the
     detail page. null shows a plain placeholder box instead.
   - gallery: array of { src, caption } — shown on the detail page only.
